## Motivation

### 1. Commonality of Hand Function Impairments
Many diseases and injuries can lead to hand function impairments, such as trigger finger, stroke, traumatic brain injuries, and neurological disorders. These impairments can severely affect patients' daily lives and independence.

### 2. Importance of Rehabilitation Therapy
Proper rehabilitation training is crucial for patients to regain hand function. Through systematic rehabilitation training, patients can rebuild hand movement and control abilities, improving their quality of life.

### 3. Limitations of Existing Rehabilitation Methods
Traditional rehabilitation therapy often requires close supervision by professional therapists, making it costly and less accessible. Without objective quantitative assessment methods, accurately tracking patients' rehabilitation progress is challenging.

### 4. Utilizing Technology to Enhance Rehabilitation Efficiency
Advanced techniques such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks enable precise monitoring and analysis of hand movements. These technologies effectively capture important spatial and temporal features from millimeter wave radar data, facilitating efficient feature extraction and processing in high-dimensional data.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** automatically extract key spatial features from millimeter wave radar data, such as joint angle changes and movement trajectories, which are critical for accurate hand movement analysis. The local perception and parameter sharing of CNN reduce the number of parameters to be learned, enhancing training efficiency and reducing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, CNN efficiently processes high-resolution data captured by the radar, reducing data dimensions while retaining key features to enhance computational efficiency.

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks focus on processing sequential data, which is essential for capturing temporal dependencies in hand movements. LSTM can effectively capture and analyze subtle changes over time in millimeter wave radar data, providing accurate dynamic assessments of hand movements and real-time feedback. Its unique structure (including input gates, forget gates, and output gates) effectively addresses the vanishing gradient problem found in traditional recurrent neural networks, maintaining the model's learning ability and accuracy over long time spans.

### 5. Promoting Patient Engagement
The willingness and motivation of patients to participate are key factors in the success of rehabilitation. An intelligent detection system can provide real-time feedback, enhancing patient engagement and making training more enjoyable, thereby improving rehabilitation willingness and outcomes.

## Implementation Objectives

### 1. Enhance Rehabilitation Efficiency
Utilize advanced radar sensing technology to accurately track hand movements, providing real-time corrections and feedback to make the rehabilitation process more efficient and goal-oriented.

### 2. Increase Patient Motivation
Enhance patient engagement and motivation during rehabilitation through visual and auditory feedback. The system design includes gamification elements, making the rehabilitation process more engaging and encouraging.

### 3. Facilitate Functional Recovery
The system provides diverse rehabilitation modes, designing different training plans for various rehabilitation stages, from basic hand activities to complex coordinated movements, comprehensively promoting hand function recovery.

### 4. Provide Customized Rehabilitation Plans
By integrating patients' specific conditions and progress, the system can automatically adjust rehabilitation plans, ensuring each patient trains at their own recovery pace to achieve optimal rehabilitation outcomes.

### 5. Track and Assess Progress
The system features robust data recording and analysis capabilities, continuously tracking patients' rehabilitation progress and evaluating outcomes. This provides real-time data support for healthcare professionals to further optimize treatment plans.

Based on the trained model, real-time recognition of users' hand movements will be conducted, assessing the accuracy and smoothness of these movements. Provide immediate feedback to help users correct their movements and enhance rehabilitation effectiveness.

### 2. Construction of Smart IoT Platform

#### 2.1 Real-Time Data Analysis and Feedback
Design real-time data analysis modules, utilizing big data techniques to analyze rehabilitation data. Provide charts and reports to help users and healthcare professionals understand rehabilitation progress, and establish a recommendation system based on analysis results to provide personalized rehabilitation suggestions.

#### 2.2 User Interface Design and Interaction
Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily access their rehabilitation data and suggestions through a web or mobile application. Support communication and interaction between users and healthcare professionals or therapists, providing real-time online support and guidance.

### 3. Security and Privacy Protection

#### 3.1 User Authentication and Access Management
Design strict user authentication mechanisms and access control policies, granting data access and operation permissions only to authorized users. Provide optional privacy settings and data sharing controls to enhance users' control and trust over their personal data.

## Expected Outcomes

### 1. Improvement in Patients' Hand Function
It is anticipated that regular rehabilitation through this system will enhance patients' grip strength, finger flexibility, and coordination. The system aims to target fine motor control and train goal-oriented tasks, such as precise manipulation of small objects and completing more complex sequences of hand movements, with initial visible rehabilitation effects expected within three months.

### 2. Increased Patient Autonomy
Utilizing the system's customizable settings, patients can independently conduct daily rehabilitation at home without frequently relying on hospital facilities. The interactive interface provided by the system makes the rehabilitation process more intuitive, allowing patients to adjust the intensity and duration of training based on personal comfort and schedules, thereby enhancing their quality of life and self-management abilities.

### 3. Real-Time Feedback and Dynamic Adjustments
The system will capture precise data on patients' hand movements in real-time and provide immediate feedback on training effectiveness, highlighting areas for improvement. The system can automatically adjust rehabilitation plans based on patients' progress, ensuring each training session is targeted and optimized.

### 4. Simplification of Monitoring Processes for Healthcare Professionals
Through remote monitoring capabilities, healthcare providers can directly receive patients' rehabilitation data from the system, including movement accuracy, progress speed, and changes in daily activity capabilities. This data support allows healthcare professionals to provide continuous assessments and timely treatment adjustments without requiring patients to visit the hospital, greatly saving medical resources and professional time.

### 5. Promotion of Telehealth Services
Successful implementation of this system will demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of telehealth in rehabilitation, providing broader geographical coverage and more efficient resource utilization in healthcare services. This will encourage more healthcare institutions and policymakers to invest in telehealth technology, especially in remote or resource-limited areas.

### 6. Generation of Academic and Clinical Research Data
The operation of this system will accumulate a substantial amount of real-time and accurate rehabilitation data, providing unprecedented support for academic research. This will aid in analyzing best practices in hand rehabilitation and developing new methods, while the accumulation of data will also promote innovations in personalized medical solutions, enhancing the overall understanding and application of rehabilitation science.
